I am an artist-programmer who explores the creation of algorithms in both digital and analog mediums, emphasizing time as a counterpoint to the fast-paced rhythm of modern life.

My work investigates the impact of algorithms on society, using them both to reflect on contemporary culture and to explore their generative possibilities, developing visual metaphors to illustrate the complexity of human relationships.
