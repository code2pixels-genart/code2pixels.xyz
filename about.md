## Who's behind "code2pixels"?

Here's a small bio of my alter ego:

> Sandro Miccoli (@sandromiccoli) is an artist, educator and creative technologist with a research focus on new media and emerging technologies. By day he works at Abstracto Studio creating interactive installations and immersive experiences for brands, events and museums. By night he delves into creating coding, live visuals and generative art. Created in 2015, code2pixels (@code2pixels_) is an art project that explores the creation of abstract, generative, and interactive artworks made with code. In 2021 code2pixels shifted from Web2 to Web3 and started to mint digital artworks as NFTs on the Tezos blockchain in several markets like Teia, fx(hash), Versum and 8bidou.
