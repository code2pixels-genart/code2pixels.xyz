"Uncertain Path" is a generative series launched on the fx(hash) platform in 2022. 

The work delves into the paths and uncertainties of the directions we take throughout life. Each piece represents a unique trajectory, starting from one point and ending at another. 

The collection is an ode to the unpredictability of the paths we traverse in life. 

"Uncertain Path" was created inspired by "La Longue Marche" (1974), a series of acrylic paintings by Argentine artist Julio Le Parc.

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/uncertain-path/19-ooDweR8NFV7HVS9ARqVjH46cTV2u3DNSm1NdnrDK3yGYwDHkUpW_1_1.png">
	<img src="/images/uncertain-path/06-ooDSiCSqmZhkbdcvm3AH9xc21r5YAwEA1HuHKmTsHkWLutmJmgW_1_1.png">
	<img src="/images/uncertain-path/14-oohwAmWF6zzthfyjd19tTwvPcxybwKkRUFkYrSBVpPMhHi6ScLE_1_1.png">
	<img src="/images/uncertain-path/20-ookYcYDtJorDxtbofL1ZGQ6Y6LQqa6R9sx7fsL4gTN7UchDb7EM_1_1.png">
	<img src="/images/uncertain-path/27-oneHNAyV3T41Q9M6QCN9UVhJM1aZqAwM9wYawchqfPUvszTi194_1_1.png">
	<img src="/images/uncertain-path/16-oo9Sbtwej9quH8Q3wx6WE2myXetHc6Yk113NenABdjyQ1VWJLEh_1_1.png">
</div>

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/uncertain-path/fxhash-c2p-uncertain-path.png">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/107469489" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
