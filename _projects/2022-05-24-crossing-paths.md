## {{ page.title }}

Launched in 2022, the Crossing Paths series of generative art celebrates the paths and crossroads in life. Each piece is unique, just like each encounter we experience. The intersections materialized in each work symbolize connections and specific moments in our journey.

The work aims to provoke reflection on the richness of these human connections, capturing ephemeral moments that linger. Each stroke represents a unique path, and each path intersects, or not, with another, inviting observers to contemplate the beauty and time of these encounters and disconnections.

Crossing Paths was created inspired by La Longue Marche (1974), a series of acrylic paintings made by Julio Le Parc.
